== SYMLOG Rating Tool

# SYMLOG Theory and Method
SYMLOG, an acronym for the System for Multiple Level Observation of Groups,
represents both theory and method for defining and analyzing the interaction
among group participants. Based upon Bales's life work, SYMLOG provides
efficient data-capture techniques allowing managers and interventionists to
collect group member perceptions about the interaction in their work group
or in the larger organization. SYMLOG, as introduced by Bales and Cohen
(1979), has been subjected to validity and reliability investigations; minor
revisions have emerged. Researchers are using SYMLOG in their investigations
of group and organizational communication; consultants are using SYMLOG to
distinguish among work groups and provide effective feedback in
interventions.

# Application
This tool supports the SYMLOG-Rating process. You can answer 26 questions
about a person and create a mapping in the SYMLOG dimensions chart. The
dimensions are 1st: exert influence vs. give up influence, 2nd: friendly vs.
unfriendly and 3rd: purposeful, self-controlled vs. emotional, expressive.
